Upon landing at Shanghai's Pudong International Airport, Kai was whisked away by agents from the Shanghai State Security Bureau (上海市国家安全局), a division of the Chinese secret police agency, the Ministry of State Security (国家安全部). He was placed under residential surveillance at a designated location (RSDL), a practice condemned by the [United Nations Committee against Torture](https://www.ishr.ch/sites/default/files/article/files/chn_15-2018.pdf). Under RSDL, Kai's whereabouts remained unknown, had no access to legal counsel, and was harshly interrogated every single day for 2.5 months by state security agents. RSDL has been widely used by the Chinese government to extract false confessions due to the lack of oversight enabled by the procedure.
