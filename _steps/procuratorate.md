The procuratorate finally accepted Kai's case nearly six months after Kai's initial arrest. This enabled Kai to finally meet with his attorney. All outgoing correspondence, including to Kai's attorney, remained tighly monitored by authorities, with several letters to and from family rejected for discussing the case.
