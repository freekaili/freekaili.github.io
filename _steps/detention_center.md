After more than 2 months of *in communicado* detention, Kai was moved to the Shanghai No. 1 Detention Center. Detention centers in China are not equipped with facilities designed for long term stays, as they are designed as temporary pre-trial housing facilities; however, Kai wound up spending 28 months at the detention center. British journalist Peter Humphreys has provided a [detailed account](https://www.ft.com/content/db8b9e36-1119-11e8-940e-08320fc2a277) of life at the detention center as well as in Qingpu Prison, where Kai would be transfered post-sentencing.

Despite Kai being informed that his case had been escalated for prosecution, officials still refused him access to legal counsel on the grounds that this would "endanger national security", even though Article 33 of China's Criminal Procedure Law ostensibly allows defendants to "entrust a defender after he/she is interrogated for the first time".
