Kai's trial was held on August 10, 2017 by the Shanghai No. 1 Intermediate People's Court after two unexplained adjournments. The trial was held behind closed doors, with US diplomats prevented from attending, in apparent violation of Article 35 of the [US-China bilateral consular convention](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/legal/travel-legal-considerations/intl-treaties/Bilateral-Consular-Conventions/Chinese-Treaty.html).
