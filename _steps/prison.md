Kai was transfered from the detention center to Qingpu Prison just over a month after his appeal hearing. This enabled him to receive semimonthly visits from family in China, and to make two 7.5-minute phone calls a month to his wife and son in the United States. Prison officials have reportedly denied Kai access to dental floss, multivitamins, and face masks, on the grounds that he is a "serious" criminal.
