On his 55th birthday, Kai and his attorney was notified that following the trial, the case had been returned to the Procuratorate for "supplemental investigation" on September 30, 2017, before being returned to the Court on October 29. This retroactive notification was presumably to follow the stipulation of Chinese criminal procedure law which states that sentencing must be announced within two months of the trial (three months if the court requests it), but the case can be kicked back to the Procuratorate for a one-month supplementary investigation. After the investigation, the Procuratorate returns the case to the court, and the three month waiting period resets; there is no known limit on how many times a case can undergo supplementary investigation after the trial.

Ultimately, Kai's case underwent two supplementary Procuratorate investigations post-trial (neither of which actually turned up any new "evidence"). Afterwards, an additional three-month extension for the announcement of a judgment was granted by the High Court.
