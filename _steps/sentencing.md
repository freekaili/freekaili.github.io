Kai was concurrently sentenced to 10 years in prison, a 50,000 RMB fine, and deportation. While some previous foreign citizens detained in China found themselves [deported before serving their sentences](https://www.duihuaresearch.org/2017/05/phan-gillis-case-highlights-deportation.html), Kai was not so fortunate.

The sentencing was carried out according to Article 111 of China's [Criminal Law](https://www.cecc.gov/resources/legal-provisions/criminal-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china). Kai's crime was deemed "serious", and thus punishable by anywhere from 10 years fixed imprisonment to life imprisonment. He is given only half credit for time served under RSDL.
