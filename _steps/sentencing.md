Kai was concurrently sentenced to 10 years in prison, a 50,000 RMB fine, and deportation. While some previous foreign citizens detained in China found themselves deported [before serving their sentences](https://www.duihuaresearch.org/2017/05/phan-gillis-case-highlights-deportation.html), evidently this did not apply to Kai.
