This *New York Times* article was the first authorized by anyone in Kai's family. However, an [article](https://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2017/04/27/Report-China-detained-American-on-charges-of-spying-for-FBI/1581493317911/) mysteriously appeared in April 2017, one day after the release of Sandy Phan-Gillis, due to an "anonymous source" that warned of "severe punishment." Evidently, this source was not well informed, as Kai has never lived or studied in California, contrary to what is reported in the article.
