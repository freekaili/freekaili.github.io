	<h2><u> Raise awareness: </u></h2>
	Share the articles on the <a href="{{site.url}}/media">Media page</a> on your social media, and follow and share the <a href="www.facebook.com/freekaili">Free Kai Li Facebook page!</a>
</div>

<div class="helpMethod">
	<h2><u> Contact members of Congress: </u></h2>
	<p>Call your senator and representative, stating your concerns about Kai Li's detention and the need for Kai's case to be publicly recognized by Secretary of State Pompeo and President Trump. A directory of senator phone numbers can be found <a href="https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm">here</a>, while house phone numbers can be found <a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives">here</a>.</p>
	<p> A perhaps more streamlined way of raising awareness in Congress is to contact the <a href="https://foreignaffairs.house.gov/">House Foreign Affairs Committee</a> at (202)-225-5021, and the <a href="https://www.foreign.senate.gov/">Senate Foreign Relations Committee </a> at (202)-224-4651. Mention your concern about Kai's detention, request with the operator that the committees hold a hearing on Kai's case, and ask for contact information for the appropriate staffer to follow up. </p>
